# Main Backup Configuration Manifest for db_backups
# ==============================================================================
# Path: /etc/db_backups/db_backups.conf
#
# File Version: 20250724.165000
#
# This file acts as a master list of all backup jobs to be considered by the
# frequency-specific backup scripts (e.g., hourly-backup.sh, daily-backup.sh).
#
# How it Works:
# 1. Each uncommented 'include /path/to/project_config.conf;' line below
#    points to a specific project's configuration file.
# 2. For each active 'include', the corresponding project configuration file
#    is loaded in an isolated run.
# 3. The project configuration file itself contains flags (e.g.,
#    BACKUP_FREQUENCY_HOURLY="on") to determine if backups for that
#    specific frequency should run for that project.
#
# To Enable/Disable a Backup Job:
# - To ENABLE a project's backups: Uncomment its 'include' line.
# - To DISABLE a project's backups: Comment out its 'include' line (add # at the start).
#
# Project Configuration Files:
# - Store individual project configuration files in a directory like
#   /etc/db_backups/conf.d/
# - A sample project configuration file can be found at:
#   /etc/db_backups/conf.d.sample/project_example.conf.sample
#   Copy this sample to /etc/db_backups/conf.d/your_project_name.conf
#   and customize it with the details needed.
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - Use ABSOLUTE paths for all 'include' directives.
# - Ensure the paths point to valid, readable configuration files.
# - The target files define all parameters for a backup job. This manifest
#   file itself should typically ONLY contain 'include' directives and comments.

# --- Example Project Configurations ---

# Example 1: A project named 'alpha_project' (currently disabled)
# Assumes configuration is in /etc/db_backups/conf.d/alpha_project.conf
#include /etc/db_backups/conf.d/alpha_project.conf;

# Example 2: Backups for 'beta_web_servers' (currently disabled)
# To enable, remove the '#' from the beginning of the next line.
# include /etc/db_backups/conf.d/beta_web_servers.conf;

# Example 3: Another project, 'gamma_critical_db' (currently disabled)
#include /etc/db_backups/conf.d/gamma_critical_db.conf;

# End of Manifest
# ==============================================================================
# Note: Any other variable assignments (e.g., DBS_TO_BACKUP=...) in this file
# will generally be ignored by the new processing model, as each frequency script
# processes included project files in isolated subshells. Global settings defined
# here won't propagate into those isolated environments as expected.
# Focus on using this file for 'include' directives only.
